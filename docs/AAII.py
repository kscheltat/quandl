a weekly basis in regards to the 6 monthsâ€™ stock market outlook. The module analyzes whether there is a connection between investor sentiment
and future performance of the S&P 500. The S&P 500 performance is measured in the relative change over 6 months. 
The AAII provides three types of sentiment namely bullish, neutral, and bearish such that bullish + neutral + bearish = 1.
